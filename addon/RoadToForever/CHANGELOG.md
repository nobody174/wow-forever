# Road to Forever (addon) changelog

Version history of the in-game addon itself. The site's history is in the
repo's root `CHANGELOG.md`.

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-02): updates and Changed markers (ADDON_PLAN.md step 4)

Not tested in the game yet; see `TESTING.md` section 8.

- **Re-importing updates your macros.** When an import changes a macro you
  already made in the game, and you haven't edited it, the real macro gets the
  new text (and icon) right away. The preview says so before you click Import
  (`2 macros you already made in the game will be updated too.`), and chat
  confirms it afterwards.
- **Your edits are kept.** If you changed one of these macros yourself, it's left
  exactly as it is; the preview and chat say which ones (`kept your edits to HS`),
  and the library still has the new version: drag it from the book and choose
  Replace if you want it.
- **Changed marker:** a small green up-arrow on the macro's icon in the Macro Book
  when an import changed a macro that's on your action bars. Hover it to see what
  changed; the arrow goes away once you've seen it. Kept-edited macros on your bars
  get the arrow too, with a tooltip explaining your version was kept.
- **Other characters catch up on login.** The library is shared by all your
  characters, so macros you made on another character are brought up to date the
  next time you log in on it (only unedited ones). Dragging an older macro from the
  book also updates it first.
- In combat, these updates wait until combat ends (one chat line says so), and are
  checked again then, so anything you edited meanwhile is still left alone.
- The Import window is a little taller so the longer preview fits.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-02): first version, Macro Book MVP (ADDON_PLAN.md step 3)

Not tested in the game yet; see `TESTING.md` for the beta checklist.

- `/r2f` opens the **Macro Book**, a spellbook-style window: side tabs for
  Universal and your class's sections, 2 x 6 macros per page, short names with
  the group underneath, the spell's icon (desaturated `Learn later` for spells
  you don't know yet), full tooltip (name, short name, body, note), page buttons,
  slot counter (`Character x / 18`, `Account y / 120`, red when full).
- **Import** window: paste the string from the site's "Copy import string",
  preview (`N macros: x new, y updated, z unchanged`, other-class and skipped
  counts), Import. The library is saved account-wide and has no size limit;
  every class's macros are kept.
- **Drag or click** a macro to create the real macro and put it on your cursor.
  Character slots first, account slots when those are full. Already created =
  just picked up again. A macro with the same name that isn't ours, or ours
  after you edited it, asks `Replace it?` [Replace] [Keep mine].
- **Tidy up** deletes Road to Forever macros that aren't on any action bar and
  that you haven't edited (with a confirm listing them).
- Right-click a macro: Remove from library, Copy text. Shift-click: body in chat.
- Combat-safe: no macro is created, edited, deleted or picked up in combat;
  Import / Tidy up grey out with `In combat`; a Tidy up confirmed in combat runs
  when combat ends.
- Settings (step 5), re-import updates of existing macros (step 4) and the main
  window + minimap button (step 6) are not in this version.
