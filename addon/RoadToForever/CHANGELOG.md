# Road to Forever (addon) changelog

Version history of the in-game addon itself. The site's history is in the
repo's root `CHANGELOG.md`.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-02): first version, Macro Book MVP (ADDON_PLAN.md step 3)

Not tested in the game yet; see `TESTING.md` for the beta checklist.

- `/r2f` opens the **Macro Book**, a spellbook-style window: side tabs for
  Universal and your class's sections, 2 x 6 macros per page, short names with
  the group underneath, the spell's icon (desaturated `Learn later` for spells
  you don't know yet), full tooltip (name, short name, body, note), page buttons,
  slot counter (`Character x / 18`, `Account y / 120`, red when full).
- **Import** window: paste the string from the site's "Copy import string",
  preview (`N macros: x new, y updated, z unchanged`, other-class and skipped
  counts), Import. The library is saved account-wide and has no size limit;
  every class's macros are kept.
- **Drag or click** a macro to create the real macro and put it on your cursor.
  Character slots first, account slots when those are full. Already created =
  just picked up again. A macro with the same name that isn't ours, or ours
  after you edited it, asks `Replace it?` [Replace] [Keep mine].
- **Tidy up** deletes Road to Forever macros that aren't on any action bar and
  that you haven't edited (with a confirm listing them).
- Right-click a macro: Remove from library, Copy text. Shift-click: body in chat.
- Combat-safe: no macro is created, edited, deleted or picked up in combat;
  Import / Tidy up grey out with `In combat`; a Tidy up confirmed in combat runs
  when combat ends.
- Settings (step 5), re-import updates of existing macros (step 4) and the main
  window + minimap button (step 6) are not in this version.
